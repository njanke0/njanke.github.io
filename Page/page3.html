			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am 27 years old born in Farmington Minnesota. I graduated as the class of 09 and joined the Army soon after. I spent 4 years in the Army in the infantry,
			with one deployment to Afghanistan in 2011, got out after my contract was done to pursue a high paying job and get my college degree. Currently I work at
			General Dynamics Mission Systems as a software engineer, working mostly in C, C#, and Python.
			I have been married for 5 years now and have a three year old son. 
			I am on my senior year of college and cannot wait for it to be over so my job stops paying me lower wages.</p>
